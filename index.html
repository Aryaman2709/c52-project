                    <li>Changing skin color is an important part of communication among Chameleons</li>
                    <li>Most Chameleons have a prehensile tail that they use to wrap around tree branches</li>

            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pigeons have excellent hearing abilities. They can detect sounds at far lower frequencies than humans are able to, and can thus hear distant storms and volcanoes.</li>
                    <li>Pigeons can fly at altitudes up to and beyond 6000 feet, and at an average speed of 77.6 mph. The fastest recorded speed is 92.5 mph.</li>
                    <li>Despite the social perception as dirty and disease-ridden, pigeons are actually very clean animals and there is very little evidence to suggest that they are significant transmitters of disease.</li>

            </center>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bears grieve deeply for others. Cubs are known to moan and cry when separated from their mothers.  This can go on for weeks if their mothers are killed by hunters.</li>
                    <li>Bears have excellent senses of smell, sight and hearing. They can smell food, cubs, a mate or predators from miles away. Their great eyesight allows them to detect when fruits are ripe.</li>
                    <li>Bears are extraordinarily intelligent animals. They have far superior navigation skills to humans; excellent memories; large brain to body ratio; and use tools in various contexts from play to hunting.</li>

            </center>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Giant pandas spend 10-16 hours a day feeding, mainly on bamboo. </li>
                    <li>At 5 months old, giant pandas learn how to climb - sometimes practicing by climbing on their mum. </li>
                    <li>Sometimes, to mark their scent, panda's climb a tree backwards with their hindfeet until they're in a full handstand upside down - enabling them to leave their scent higher up. </li>

            </center>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cicadas can survive a huge fall as babies, or nymphs. They are about the size of a grain of rice when they drop from a tree branch to the ground and start digging.</li>
                    <li> Most have red-orange eyes. But occasionally cicadas have blue, white or grayish eyes. Keep on the lookout.</li>
                    <li>Females may be attracted to the sound of motors. So you get to watch your dad, mom or older sibling get swarmed while they’re using the lawn mower or power tools.</li>
